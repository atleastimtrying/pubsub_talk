      <h1>What is PubSub?</h1>
      <ul>
        <li>Short for Publish/Subscribe</li>
        <li>Also known as the Observer Pattern</li>
        <li>A simple design pattern</li>
        <li>
          <blockquote>
            One or more observers are interested in the state of a subject and register their interest with the subject by attaching themselves. When something changes in our subject that the observer may be interested in, a notify message is sent which calls the update method in each observer. When the observer is no longer interested in the subject's state, they can simply detach themselves.
